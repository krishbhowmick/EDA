# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Data exploration is the very first step in the data analysis process. It all begins with exploring a large set of unstructured data while looking for patterns, characteristics, or points of interest. Summarizing the size, accuracy and initial patterns in the data is key to enabling deeper analysis. The purpose of this process is meant to help create a broader picture of potential trends or points to look for upon further analysis to refine the data.
